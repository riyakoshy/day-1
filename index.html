    <h5> This is my commute today </h5>
    <p> On the way to class today, I stopped and got a bagel. But I <mark>still</mark> haven't gotten the chance to eat it yet. I then waited for the N, Q, or R trains. One <mark>finally</mark> showed up. It was hot and there was no A/C. I somehow made it to class on time. </p>
