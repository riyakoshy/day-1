	    <p>You are now watching the throne, don't let me get in my zone. You tellin' me people don't look at Kanye West like the glitch? I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be 'architected.' Because I sit back and think 'Am I the only one that's not crazy? I'm a creative genius and there's no other way to word it. This one Corbusier lamp was, like, my greatest inspiration. Nobody can tell me where I can and can't go. Man, I'm the number one living and breathing rock star.</p>
