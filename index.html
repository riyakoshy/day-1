    <h1 style="color:Tomato;"> Hello, Gakko! </h1>
    <p> On the way to class today, I stopped and got a bagel. But I <strong>still</strong> haven't gotten the chance to eat it yet. I then waited for the N, Q, or R trains. One <em>finally</em> showed up. It was hot and there was no A/C. I somehow made it to class on time. </p>
